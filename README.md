CLEVER is an educational programmable drone kit consisting of an unassembled quadcopter, open source software and documentation. The kit includes Pixhawk/Pixracer autopilot running PX4 firmware, Raspberry Pi 3 as companion computer, a camera for computer vision navigation as well as additional sensors and peripheral devices.

Copter Express has implemented a large number of different autonomous drone projects using exactly the same platform: [automated pizza delivery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkAoZOtF58) in Samara and Kazan, coffee delivery in Skolkovo Innovation Center, [autonomous quadcopter with charging station](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjX6nUqw1mI) for site monitoring and security, winning drones on [Robocross-2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGbDaz_VmYU) and [Robocross-2017](https://youtu.be/AQnd2CRczbQ) competitions and many others.

**The main documentation in Russian is available [on our Gitbook](https://clever.copterexpress.com/).**

Use it to learn how to assemble, configure, pilot and program autonomous CLEVER drone.
